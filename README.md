[Jotform Widget Documentation](https://www.jotform.com/developers/widgets/). API and how to publish it on your form

[List of all the widgets](https://eu.jotform.com/widgets/category/other). There is a button on the bottom right to add new widgets. Press the button "My widgets" to show your custom widgets

I have created another branch `gh-pages` with the file `.nojekyll` in order to upload changes directly.
